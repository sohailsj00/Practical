###Check Whether a Given Number is Prime or Not in Java


```bash

Example
Input : 23
Output : Prime

```


Method 1: Simple iterative solution (PRIMWusingiterative.java)
Method 2: Optimization by break condition(PMUsingBreak.java)
Method 3: Optimization by n/2 iterations(PMusingItration.java)
Method 4: Optimization by âˆšn (PMUsingSqrt.java)
Method 5: Optimization by skipping even iteration(PMUsingEvenItration.java)
Method 6: Basic Recursion technique
